# FastAPI Contacts Server

FastAPI Contacts Server is a REST API built with FastAPI for managing contacts (users) using a MySQL database. The project is fully containerized and can be run either with Docker Compose for local development or with Kubernetes (Minikube) for a cluster-based environment.

The API exposes CRUD endpoints for managing contacts.  
GET /contacts returns all contacts.  
POST /contacts creates a new contact.  
PUT /contacts/{id} updates an existing contact.  
DELETE /contacts/{id} deletes a contact.

When creating a contact, the required fields are first_name, last_name, and phone_number. Each contact is stored in a MySQL database and receives an auto-generated id.

The database used is MySQL and runs on port 3306. All data is stored persistently inside the database container or Kubernetes pod.

To run the project using Docker Compose, make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed. Clone the repository, navigate to the project root directory where the docker-compose.yml file is located, and run:

docker compose up --build

After the services start, the FastAPI server will be available at http://localhost:8000 and the MySQL database will be available on port 3306.

To run the project using Kubernetes with Minikube, make sure Docker, kubectl, Minikube, and a Docker Hub account are available. First, build and push the Docker image from the directory containing the Dockerfile:

docker build -t <dockerhub-username>/apiserver:v1 .
docker push <dockerhub-username>/apiserver:v1

Then start Minikube:

minikube start

From the directory containing the Kubernetes Pods and Services YAML files k8s, deploy the resources:

kubectl apply -f .

To access the API service, run:

minikube service api-service

You can verify that everything is running correctly by checking the pods, services, and logs:

kubectl get pods  
kubectl get svc  
kubectl logs api

Docker Compose is recommended for local development, while Kubernetes with Minikube is recommended for learning and production-like environments. Both setups use the same Docker image and application code.
